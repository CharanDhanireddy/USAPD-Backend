QUERY 1: Seasonal pollutant trends 
DESCRIPTION 1: Study how the levels of different pollutants has varied over the seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) over a given time period. Plan your vacations better, to catch the magnificent views of a state during its expected least polluted season as per previous trends. 

QUERY 2: Day of the week pollution trends
- DESCRIPTION 2: Study the trend of how the average pollutant levels change as the week progresses, over a 5 year period. Choose the least polluted day to go on a hike with a friend or a loved one.

QUERY 3: Hourly pollution trends
DESCRIPTION 3: Study the trend of which hour of the day, on an average, had the highest level of the pollutant over a selected time period. Plan your daily commute or your jogs better, to avoid pollution when it is relatively unsafe. 

QUERY 4: Compare state pollution levels
DESCRIPTION 4: Compare levels of a single pollutant between multiple (upto 4) states over a given time period. Check if you're sensitive to a specific pollutant before traveling or migrating to a state.

QUERY 5: Recommended AQI levels
DESCRIPTION 5: Study the number of days, in a state, where the AQI level was higher than its recommended safe value. Check and take caution if you're living in a state that consistently breaches the safe level of pollutants in the air.

QUERY 6: Map depiction: States that in the year 2020 had average AQI higher(red) or lower(green) than the recommended safe value.

QUERY 7: Population vs pollution trends
DESCRIPTION 7: Study the trend if the change in the population of a state, resulted in a corresponding change in the pollution levels for that state. If you're a researcher or if you're just inquisitive about the effect of population changes on the pollution in a state, this one's for you.
